<p>
  If you don't need a whole house, you may opt for a hotel or inn.
<p>
  When you arrive at Old Harbor by ferry, the <strong>Harborside Inn</strong> might be the first thing to catch your eye as you approach. In addition to being an island landmark, it boasts 36 guest rooms, plus waterfront restaurant The Harbor Grill.
<p>
  For those seeking luxury and privacy, <strong>The 1661</strong> is a top choice - it features 9 guest roons and 7 nearby cottages, and is open year-round. Enjoy a champagne brunch and complimentary afternoon hors d'oevres, and explore the nearby farm and garden.
<p>
  The <strong>Spring House Hotel</strong> is another island favorite. In its 160-plus years, the hotel has hosted guests such as Billy Joel and Mark Twain. It boasts a restaurant serving lunch and dinner plus 33 guedt rooms, and is situated on an expansive lawn overlooking the water.
