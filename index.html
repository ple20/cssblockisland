<h1>Welcome to Block Island!</h1>
<p>
Labeled by The Nature Conservancy as <em>"One of the 12 last great places in the Western Hemisphere,"</em> Block Island boasts pristine beaches, over 30 miles of trails, 365 freshwater ponds, and centuries of history, from the Naragansett Indians to the Revolutionary War.
<p>
<h2>History</h2>
<div>
Thousands of years ago, Block Island was formed by a glacier, and the Naragansett Indians were the first people to call it home. They called it "Manisses," meaning "Island of the Little God."
When Dutch explorer Adrian Block discovered the island in 1614, he named it Block Island. The island was settled in 1661. New Shoreham was established in 1672, and remains Block Island's only town.
<div>
<em>Fun Fact: To this day, New Shoreham is the smallest town in the smallest state in the country.</em>
</div>
Block Island is just 12 miles off the coast of Rhode Island. At 7 miles long and 3 miles wide, the island covers 7,000 acres. Though it draws between 15,000 and 20,000 seasonal visitors a day, only about 1,000 residents call the island home year-round.
